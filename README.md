# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

#This app is not complete
I worked on this app as much as I could before realizing I don't have the time to finish the app. I was able to get the aesthetics down but the functionality isn't all the way there.

#What's not working
The buttons to the to devour and the buttons to submit isn't working. Also, connection to heroku isn't working.

#Future
I'm going to have to look at this code in the future, when I have a better understanding of heroke, handlebars, and mysql
